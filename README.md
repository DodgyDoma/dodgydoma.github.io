Welcome! This is my GitHub page, although it's primarily for testing purposes at this point.

I'm just trying out GitHub Pages because I'm bored and I realized that I have a GitHub account. Anyway, here's a little bit of content for whoever is interested.

# Education
2020-2025: Neumann János High School, Eger

Since September 2025: Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics, Electrical Engineering BSc (German program, hopefully going to work out)

I might expand this website in the future, but don't have high expectations.
